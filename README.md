# Pizza Hut Mock Page
### Project for Hackerschool's Recruitment 

To access the website this page was based on, just go to `https://www.pizzahut.pt/` and you'll be
redirected to `https://www.pizzahut.pt/em-tua-casa/entrega-ao-domicilio/promocoes/`, which is the 
part of the website which has the "Em tua casa" tab active.

This website isn't responsive, therefore, the "Em tua casa" tab is always the active one with no possibility to change it (maybe one day, who knows).

In addition, I mocked the first part of the website, the main navigation bar (the white one),
and the 2 sub navigation bars (the red ones), the first promotion and contact info. I didn't include
the "Outras Ofertas" (Other Offers) part and neither did I include the footer.
